## ðŸš€ Usage

This tool simplifies XSS exploitation by combining a socket-based HTTP server with the power of ngrok. 
It enables you to quickly launch a local server and make it publicly accessible, making it easier to share payloads or demonstrate XSS vulnerabilities. 
There are basically two endpoints

- `/FILENAME`: Serves a file from the `files/` directory, like a standard HTTP server.
- `/?cookie=XXX`: Only logs the value of `XXX`, useful for testing cookie capture scenarios.
- `/.*`: Logs any access to other endpoints directly in your console, giving you full visibility into unexpected requests.

Ideal for pentesters, security researchers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts who need a lightweight and versatile tool for XSS testing.
